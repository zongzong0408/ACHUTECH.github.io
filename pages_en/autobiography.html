                        When I was in elementary school, I became interested in programming blocks because of using Scratch software, 
                        and then I came to junior high school to connect with high school.
                        Inspired by the information teacher at the school, I knew clearly that I wanted to engage in the field of information with a clear goal, 
                        so that the subject of information became a own field of expertise and become an excellent person in it.
